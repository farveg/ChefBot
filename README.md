# ChefBot
A chatbot meant to answer questions about difficult cooking terms.

This project aims to use a neural network to classify intents of the user and generate a response based on the term provided. In its first iteration the bot will simply define these terms, but I hope to add more in-depth relations between lexical entries in the future.
